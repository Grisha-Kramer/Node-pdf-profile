Homework 7


It took a while to find the best npm module, and I had to delete and reinstall them once because of install issues.  Then much later it turned out there was one up in the slack channel.

As of yet I can't get the stars to display correctly, it seems like I would have to build a whole section just to deal with that.

Update: got the stars working with a little help from the homework slack channel.

To build:  If I were to continue working on this I'd probably make it open the pdf automatically.
